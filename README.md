# FeelingArt
Track my feelings from day to day and use that to create art. Each feeling will be represented by a color. 
 - Each day I track feelings by selecting from the available list.
 - This will eventually result in a keyword cloud.
 - The keywords will be represent colors which will then be used to form images or random colors on a page.
 - There could be a lot of different output formats to choose from or switch between.
   - Abstract art
   - Self potrate
   - Scatter graph
   - Line graph
